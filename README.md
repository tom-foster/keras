# Keras introduction

Picking up keras library with Tensorflow backend.

All projects focus on deep learning specifically to supplement my work.

Mainly example datasets.

## Don't forget!

Windows linux subsystem

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6

#change to directory
cd /mnt/d/Users/Tom/Documents/
mkdir keras

#activate using python3.6
python3.6 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

python --version 
[Console]: Python 3.6.6
```

## Things to do in the future

Project doesn't look like it can be completed using plaidML without using powershell. WLS won't recognise graphics card currently.

Switched to MINGW64, command key difference in installing on Windows is this line!!!

source venv/Scripts/activate

Will have to use powershell for this, which means venv is activated in a different way.
